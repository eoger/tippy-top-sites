# Tippy Top Sites

This repo is meant to provide a hand curated set of icons, colors, and titles for use in [Activity Stream](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-streams). It is meant as a temporary solution to ugly data. We should do something much better very soon.

## Tests

You must first install dependencies with `npm install`. Then run:

```
npm test
```
