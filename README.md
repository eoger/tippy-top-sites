# Tippy Top Sites

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nchapman/tippy-top-sites.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nchapman/tippy-top-sites)

This repo is meant to provide a hand curated set of icons, colors, and titles for use in [Activity Stream](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-streams). It is meant as a temporary solution to ugly data. We should do something much better very soon.

## Setup

You must first install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Commands

```
npm start   Runs a preview server at http://localhost:8080
npm test    Runs tests.
```
